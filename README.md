#foundation

Zurb Foundation CSS framework component

[http://foundation.zurb.com](http://foundation.zurb.com/)

### usage
As this module doesn't export the jQuery object directly, it provides a `foundation.init` method that you can call with `foundation.init(element)` â€“`element` being either `document` or a particular element in which you want the foundation plugins to work.
